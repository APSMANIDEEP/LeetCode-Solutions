# LeetCode-Solutions

Hello Everyone! 

My name is A P S Manideep. I'm currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Delhi. Recently I have started doing competitive coding on LeetCode. I understood that the best way to learn something is to teach someone or to share with someone. Through this repository, I want to share the approach to the problems in LeetCode that I followed and also the solution that I submitted. 

Python is the major language that I use for programming. I can code in other languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript. All the solutions that I have uploaded in this repository are in Python. I'll try to add solutions in other languages whereever I can. 

I used to have some doubts before starting the competitive coding. Everyone at their very first level, get these doubts like and this is what I found out. I wanted to share if you are beginner or if you have the same doubts. 
- **Which Programming Language should you use?**
  - ANS: You can use any programming language. Because language really does not matter. Only the logic and the algorithm that you implement really matters. But if you are preparing for a company's interview which has a specific preference of language, then choose that language. But in almost 99% of the cases, you will have the freedom to choose your own language.
- **Are compiled langugaes like C, C++, Java better than Python or JavaScript for Competitive Coding?**
  - ANS: Most people have the same doubt as interpreted language like Python is slower than compiled languages like C or C++. But remember that every language has its own capabilities. Do not compare one language with other language. Do not compare Python's speed with C++. Just compare the complexity of the algorithm that you have used. Because whatever language you use, the algorithm you write for the problem must be optimal with respect to time and space complexities. Try to compare Python with Python only in case of different algorithms and same language. But do not compare same algorithm in different languages. Instead compare their complexities in time and space.
  
  (I'll keeping updating this document with more and more beginner friendly questions like these.)
  
  Last but not the least, we are all human beings and its very common that we do mistakes. All that matters is how we correct ourselves and the mistakes that we did. If you find any mistake in my code or my approach, or if you have more optimal approach than mine, please kindly suggest it. I'll definitely go through it and correct and update myself and my code. Learning is a mutual give and take process.
  
  Thank You
